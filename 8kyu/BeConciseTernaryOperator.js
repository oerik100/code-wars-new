// Problems
// You are given a function describeAge / describe_age that takes a parameter age (which will always be a positive integer) and does the following:

// If the age is 12 or lower, it return "You're a(n) kid"
// If the age is anything between 13 and 17 (inclusive), it return "You're a(n) teenager"
// If the age is anything between 18 and 64 (inclusive), it return "You're a(n) adult"
// If the age is 65 or above, it return "You're a(n) elderly"
// Your task is to shorten the code as much as possible. Note that submitting the given code will not work because there is a character limit of 137.

// Solution
function describeAge(age) {
  let x="You're a(n) "
  return age<=12?`${x}kid`:age <= 17?`${x}teenager`:age<=64?`${x}adult`:`${x}elderly`}
